# Clowns

Welcome to your new gem! Clowns! HAHHAAAA! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/clowns`. HAHHAAAA. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt. HAAHAA..

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clowns'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install clowns

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Publishing a prerelease version of the gem

1. In your development branch, bump the gem version number and include a prerelease string.
2. Manually trigger the [prerelease workflow](../../actions/workflows/manual-prerelease.yml), specifying the name of your development branch.
